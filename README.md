# Discord Bot Movement

Bot Movement is a simple Discord Bot for moving multiple People with Slash 
Commands.

Since there is sadly no default implementation in discord for moving multiple
Users from one Channel to another one.

## Usage

Currently there are 2 diffrent Commands implemented:

``/mass_move_channel`` used to move ALL User from one channel into another 
channel.

``/move_select_user`` used to move just selected Users from one channel into 
another channel.
